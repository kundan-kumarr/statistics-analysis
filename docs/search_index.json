[["statistics.html", "Chapter 2 Statistics 2.1 Terminology 2.2 Mathematical Notation", " Chapter 2 Statistics 2.0.1 What is statistics? It is methods for Collecting, Describing, Analyzing,and drawing conclusions from Data with Random Variation. The methods are used for : a. Designing it •Planning research studies •How to obtain the required data Description •Summarizing data •Exploring patterns in the data •Extract/condense information •Graphical pictures of the data Inference •“Infer” from sample to population •Generalize •Make predictions based on the data 2.1 Terminology 2.1.1 Population – total set of all subjects of interest – the entire group of people, animals or things about which we want information Example – All Iowa State University students • Elementary Unit – any individual member of the population Example – any Iowa State University Student 2.1.2 Sample – subset of the population from which the study actually collects information – used to draw conclusions about the whole population Example – The class of STAT587-3 – All graduate ISU students – All male ISU students – 40 Randomly selected ISU students 2.1.3 Variable – a characteristic of a unit that can vary among subjects in the population/sample Examples: – gender, nationality, age, income, hair color, height, disease status, grade in STAT 587-3, state of residence • Random Variable – Variable with random variation Example: – gender of the first person that will call you tomorrow – Your grade in the Final exam of STAT 587-3 2.1.4 Parameter – numerical characteristic of the population – based on the whole population • Example – Proportion of male among ISU students • Statistic – numerical characteristic of the sample – calculated using the sample • Example – Proportion of male students in STAT 587-3 All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. 2.2 Mathematical Notation 2.2.1 Sample Mean 2.2.2 Sample Measures of Variation 2.2.3 Stem and Leaf Plot 2.2.4 Central Limit Theorem "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
